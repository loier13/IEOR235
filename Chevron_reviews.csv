Cons

They do you have work life balance and they actually mean it. They encourage you to transfer to different job about every 3 to 4 years, so you can learn more about the company and grow your skills. I loved working there
";"The pay is ok, its may be a little lower compared to some companies, but they make up for it other benefits, pensions, stocks, and stable work place most of the time. they do have reorganizations about every 4 years depending on the market and Oil/Gas prices

2021-07-19;Corporate Position;Current Employee, more than 8 years;bureaucratic mess, good benefits;"Decent salary and good benefits. People are generally nice. Can be really cushy if you're OK just doing the minimum to get a good review/bonus. I think the happiest people are the ones who find a sweet spot and ride things out for a long period (long-term benefits are great).
";"We're in a slowly dying industry and lack a clear direction forward. This is reflected in our inability to attract and retain talent from top universities. Think to yourself, why would an engineer from Stanford go to Chevron instead of a tech firm? Internally, we have an exhausting bureaucracy that is highly political and difficult to navigate. At the heart, this is an engineering company, and it is presumed that engineers can do anything. In an era of changing dynamics and enormous pressure from investors and policymakers to move away from fossil fuels, the old school engineer mentality could end up being our downfall. If you're not an engineer (i.e., you're a market analyst, economist, climate person) I'd recommend staying away--you're career path will likely be limited here, and you'll be frustrated by the slow pace, extra work to deal with enormous overhead, and lack of clarity on our goals.

";"No full time hours available, cant use sick hours since there are only a small number of people working, dealing with drunk/high people a lot, dealing with angry customers a lot, a lot of homeless people come by try to lay down by the store or steal something, owner doesn't care about fixing the pumps or the employee bathroom, the manager will bend over backwards for any customer but wont protect their own employees from harrassment, HR doesnt care either and will only protect the manager since she's their lapdog and will do whatever they say, HR will get mad at you for clocking in 2 or 3 minutes too early and counts that as ""overtime"". There is no employee break room, so you'll have to hang out in the soapy Joe's break room, There is no room for promotion, even one of the other cashier's that has been here for 4 years makes the same amount as someone working there for 1 year, due to the owner wanting to save more money in his pocket. Even everything in the store went up by .30 cents and the gas a few months ago was $4.19 to $4.79. I have a bad feeling this store will be going out of business in the next 2 years.

2021-05-13;Sales Representative;Current Employee, more than 10 years;Good company but a little boring;"Great recognition of home/life balance. Good pay...especially when combined with the lower stress environment vs. other companies. Well managed company. Employees are are generally nice. Management/leadership team members is approachable/accessible and 'part of the team'. Management acts with integrity. Generally supportive of employee development. Amazingly supportive for an oil company (HQ in California and you can tell).
";"Very buttoned down and bland culture. All the personality has been scrubbed out...just not that fun on a day to day basis. Some of the office locations are so boring. Too quiet, no chatter, few friendships. Career path is mostly self directed...it's on you to figure out how to climb the ladder. Despite all the talk about diversity & inclusion there has not been much progress. Management team isn't really interested in 'diversity of thought' and don't appreciate opinions that run counter to management strategies. An amazing lack of spine when it comes to managing employees who aren't getting the job done.

Also leadership styles are different that things can vary so much from supervisor, shift, and message received to the operators and contractors. 3. The previous owner of this refinery left an impact on the work force and the reliability of the plant. leading to disconnect between leadership and operations. 4.

As an external hire who has spent a number of years here, I can say this place is as good as your manager and perhaps worse since the opportunities to switch roles seems to have dried up with the org changes.

";"Very low pay for the job. An average DSM makes roughly 120k-150k. Other companies are 200k+. The benefits are now horrible to keep up dividends for shareholders. Old timers said the company was lower paying but had job security compared to other O&G jobs, not anymore. Layoffs every 3-4 years for field staff. The field will have promotion freezes and layoffs but all the office staff sits safely in their positions or even promotions amid field layoffs. Finally they are so woke for diversity and inclusion that they discriminate against white males. The company went from one of the best to work for to one of the worst. Chevron is a typical woke, liberal, California company.

2020-12-27;Senior Human Resources Business Partner;Current Employee, more than 10 years;Great intentions, trips over itself seometimes;"Managers and leadership at Chevron care about their employees and spend the time and money to show it. It's almost painful sometimes and several lifelong Chevron employees don't realize how great they have it. You're also working with a large number of capable people who want to do good work. In my experience, if those that are only a few months away from retirement still put in significant effort. They want the company and the people there to succeed.
";"I don't think this is unique to Chevron, more a consequence of being a large company with long-tenured employees - in many groups voicing disagreement or new ideas has to be done very skillfully or you can come off as 'a jerk' even if it would be considered fairly polite at other companies. It's a very heavy 'nice' culture that can slow things down.

";"Like many corporations, Chevron is bending the knee to the ""Social Justice"" movement. This means that the workforce is being atomized and pitted against itself. Reference Chevron's press releases from earlier this year crowing about how personnel reductions at upper levels had disproportionately affected white men. This trend can be linked to some large investors very loudly proclaiming a focus on so-called ""ES&G"" metrics. This also brings about an irrational focus on ""going green"". Up until a year or so ago, I was proud to see Chevron was resisting the industry trend of mouthing the ""Carbon is bad"" mantra. This has flipped and quickly in the last year. Terrible for morale

";"I've worked here for almost 12 years and on the last six years I have gone thru four company transformation events which means that you need to reapply and compete for your own job (if it is still there) and a lot of people get fire.

2020-11-15;Finance Manager;Current Employee, more than 10 years;Not the Company it Once Was;"In general the benefits are pretty good. The company focuses on safety. A fairly good work life balance, but constant downsizings have eroded some of this. The company has many employee networks to improve employee experience. The company is trying to take care of the thousands of employees being laid off.
";"I hate to say it, but avoid this company like the plague. I used to love working for Chevron, but now I’m just trying to hang on until retirement. Constant downsizing has destroyed the previous collaborative culture. It is now a dog eat dog company. Politics rule all decisions. Personnel decisions are based on favoritism and cliques. If you do not have a powerful sponsor, prepare for a lousy job or a target on your back for the next downsizing. The focus is on cost cutting and improving the bottom line. This is a declining industry and management has not made any meaningful changes to embrace a lower-carbon future. If you are in any service function your job will be automated or outsourced to Philippines or Argentina. If you are a petrotech, it’s still not too bad, but if you have a long career left, get out of O&G. Retrain yourself. We are coming through a massive downsizing and will probably have another in less than two years.

";"I.T. is the worst I've seen at any company. I think it has to do with the fact Chevron pumps money out of the ground and throws money at everything. I've worked at a lot of companies and I.T. side is pretty bad filled with great talkers but mostly just talkers... only at Chevron can you ruin an entire business unit I.T. system smooth talk it and get promoted to upper management. Blows my mind, but, play the game right, let water slide over your back and move on in life - it is what it is.
