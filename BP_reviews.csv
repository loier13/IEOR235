29/09/2021;Procurement performance Manager;Current Employee, more than 10 years;Good Company;#NOM?;"-Easy to 'get lost' in the masses. Type 'A' personalities will enjoy success here. -Promotions are hard to obtain. Ceilings can come quick. Jobs are highly competitive and circumventing internal openings can be complex. Performance ratings too subjective. -Organization is too complex. Often no clear distinctions on job responsibilities between functions/businesses. -Decisions are often by 'committee' and things can take time. -Plenty of 'finger pointing' when things do not go right. -Diversity programs seem to focus on certain groups over others (even to the point where it gets highly political)

05/10/2021;ARC Advisor;Current Employee, more than 10 years;BP;"BP is a global company with international scope. There are opportunities to do many different things. In the last couple of years, the strategy at BP was changed to pursue renewables and move away from Oil. If that is your thing, enjoy.
";"BP tends to send many jobs offshore and that trend will continue. They are also moving to automate many processes. Reducing headcount is a strategy at BP. It can often feel heartless and sterile to see people who have devoted many years in service to the company to be quietly laid off. There are many who see a downward trend at BP in terms of future earnings potential given that they intend to move away from Oil. This is a concern for both investors and employees.

Strong support of diversity of ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation.
";"BP favors friendliness over delivery and accountability. The management team acts as if they are smarter than everyone else. They are manipulative and do not treat people with respect. A few people do most of the work. Despite friendly appearances, they do not like Americans.

08/01/2021;Category Specialist;Current Employee, more than 3 years;Beware of BP;"The work is interesting and the coworkers are generally friendly. I was always paid on time.
";"You should be aware that BP has an official program that involves paying financial incentives to managers when diversity targets are met for women and/or Black employees. If you are a non-Black male, I strongly urge you to pursue other employers. Before I joined BP, the company had a reputation for two things: catastrophic accidents and layoffs. As a current employee, I think that reputation is well deserved. BP invests heavily in outsourcing technologies and the company retains an army of staff who design workflows and work processes for others. What this means is that your job will constantly change, it will constantly be designed and re-designed by people who lack experience in the roles and do not have endure the consequences of their decisions, and you will always be at risk of being laid off. I doubt you will ever have a feeling of job security, and because of that, your personal relationships and happiness will likely suffer. Believe me when I say that you do not want to work here. You will have a better career and better life elsewhere. The third and final thing that you should be aware of is that BP is excellent at saying no. I have never observed a single instance of BP saying yes to something that was not already explicitly approved in a policy. No matter the situation or circumstance, based on my experience, the answer will always be no. If you are reckless enough to accept a role at BP, you should expect to hear the word often.

17/01/2021;Exploration Geologist;Former Employee, more than 10 years;Recent layoffs won't be the last ... Run away if you're a geoscientist;"Pretty good work-life balance, good benefits, good severance package (for now). Lots of smart and talented people, at least where I worked. Good diversity and inclusion.
";"Recent layoffs have gutted the company, leaving it understaffed and lacking experience. The transformation to an Agile work environment means staff are deployed on projects and seem to rush to get work done during the sprints. This might lead to the 80% solution becoming the 50% solution. New CEO bernard looney has re-imagined bp by transforming it into a utility company and shrinking oil and gas production 40% by 2030, and even less by 2050. The end result is that if you're a geoscientist and want a career in oil & gas, you should see working at bp as a dead-end and start looking for a new employer. In exploration, every new discovery is another step closer to making your job redundant. Upward mobility was challenging before the reorganization, so in order to advance people were leaving exploration to go to other companies. Now, it will be even harder. The latest layoffs were done in an opaque manner.

";"Very poor management coming from London. No good idea can ever come from outside the UK. The last 10 years, every decision made has had bad repercussion on the business, workers and knowledge depletion and yet shareholders keep getting paid at the expense of workers. Higher ups are a closed club and they only promote within their restricted group. New CEO fooled everyone with his supposed ""in touch with workers"" attitude when in reality he is ruthless and is totally out of touch with reality. He spent ""Tweeting or Yammering"" instead of truly running the business (reminds me of TRUMP). Managers are promoted based on who you know and not what you accomplish. Some managers are sooooooo bad that they keep bouncing from one division to the other wrecking havoc but never get fired. In general this organization is absolutely terrible at running assets....hence everytime they sold one, the new owners made out really well and ran that assets 100% better than when it was in BP's hands. This is all due to too much red tape. I view this organization as an oil tanker that takes forever to make a turn while it's competitors are more nimble and are more like frigates. The last 10 years, BP went through 5 reorg all by reducing headcounts or selling assets. The organization is just too lean to function properly and is constantly trying to put up fires that get started because of the lack of bodies/personnel.

";"Big global company that at times is too top heavy to make decisions. Can be a large disconnect between local business units central teams (people in London and Houston don’t always know how oil and gas production works and the ramifications and effort it takes to deliver what is asked). Also BP likes to change, saying around here goes “if you don’t like something, wait two years, it’ll change.” Can’t learn from mistakes, constantly changing systems to new systems that don’t work properly, unsupported and don’t meet requirements. Have now started rolling out new enterprise systems that don’t work properly for weeks after launch and with no actual training on how they work. Employees are expected to just figure it for themselves. Lots debt and expenses from oil spill, oil price downturn and buying assets has led them to sell current assets.

";"After the Macondo disaster, they decided to hire a lot of very qualified people to fix their supplier contract problems, Supplier quality, on-time delivery, improving KPIs and other metrics of performance, etc. It was all a huge facade. At the end of the day, they ground down these highly qualified new hires with red-tape, bureaucracy, and the worst inefficiency. All they really wanted was to look good if they were audited. Not to really fix any of the structural problems that caused the Gulf of Mexico catastrophe to begin with. A lot of copy-and-paste in Excel. a lot of BS KPIs, when category managers have no access to on-time-delivery or to Quality from suppliers. They don't even approve a trip to Lousiana from Houston, for god sakes! If you want to be well paid and look the other way, this is the place for you. If you rock the boat, they will make your life a living hell and drive you out.

Vacation time relatively weak compared to competition, but management in generally flexible if there are family issues that limit your work availability. Salary is reasonable, but much better can be had in industry, new bonus structure is good (if you have a good relationship with your supervisor), disappointing otherwise. Benefits are solid. Worldwide work locations with opportunities for advancement if you toe the company line and keep your opinion to yourself.
";"Alot of processes and red tape, trumping common sense more often than not. It's often unclear who is accountable and who makes decisions with constantly shifting management priorities. Too many layers of management that are reorganized and shuffled every 12 to 18 months and regularly roll out non-value adding initiatives that create a ton of work for technical staff, get some manager a promotion, and leave unrealistic expectations for the next manager. Internal job postings are ""just for show"", new roles and promotion opportunities are largely pre-determined and based on diversity and politics rather than merit.

";"This place is teeming with incompetent employees, especially managers. BP goes out of its way to protect incompetent managers that waste the company hundreds of millions of dollars instead of sacking them. The company is very clique-y and if you're not part of the ones that managers like, even if you do your job well, the managers will make sure to get rid of you and replace you with one of their buddies. It's very dogmatic and behind the times. BP is not a leader in the industry, it's a follower. Instead of coming up with new ideas, they just keep reworking the same problem over and over with the same mindset and never find a solution to anything. Anyone that tries to challenge dogma and come up with new ideas is considered a trouble-maker and someone that rocks the boat. Management doesn't want anyone to think outside the box and come up with solutions to problems, even though they say ad nauseam that they do, because God forbid that someone exposes their incompetence. All they want is complacent worker bees that keep their heads down and brown nose managers' insatiable egos. No wonder Exxon and the other majors think of BP as a joke. When this company continues to compare their performance to those of the minors instead of the majors, you know there's something seriously wrong. Instead of improving their standards, they just set the bar very low.

They also tested you and asked situational questions. It appeared as if they had good cultural values, benefits, and solid management staff.
";"I interviewed and you could tell no one laughed, spoke to one another, very tense. Even the people interviewing looked tired. I was told there was a pension but when I asked about it, no! Now the recruiter told me there was. So, is this a trick to hire people? Ask everyone the same questions to make sure you have the same answers! The benefits for health care are the same at other places. I think they have lost their value in IL.

This leads to a lot of “jack of all trade and masters of none” types. Also leads to a constant chaotic environment in terms of getting things done. -Still a stigma between the GBS and the imbedded business.

";"Management doesn’t have a clear vision. L48 headquarters was moved to Denver, even though most of the onshore assets are in Texas. There is a Denver vs. Houston mentality which originated from the current onshore CEO. L48 has been laying off high performers in Houston and the field, which has caused safety issues, but are hiring positions that are laughable at best like Culture Representatives and Executive Concierge in Denver. The Denver office is spending money as if L48 is an oil driven company, but it’s not. L48 is a gas driven company.

If you're on a good team or find good mentors, you can have a very successful career here and there is no set ""career path"" so you can find which part of the business you like and steer yourself in that direction.
";"It's very team dependent. You can love one team, and dislike the next. Your manager really makes or breaks your experience. As with any large company it is very political and hard to get things done in a timely manner as it has to go through many different departments to get approval. A lot of the older people at the company are just completely content working 8-4 with a decent salary and good benefits and have zero sense of urgency to get anything done, so as a younger professional trying to make a name for yourself that can be extremely frustrating. No semblance of a ""culture"" whatsoever, even though you can tell management has tried very hard to get that after the oil spill.

11/07/2018;Gas Station Attendant;Current Employee, more than 1 year;Just Don't;"A large number of the customers are quite a joy to talk to when they come in from their daily cigarettes or gas-up.
";"The managers/owners are childish and inexperienced in managing businesses. This alone is not a total condemnation, but the fact that they treat their employees (and even family members) more like animals or machines than actual people, as well as the matter of lying about payment methods, shady business practices that involved paying me from an alternate store location (technically a different company) in order to avoid paying me overtime on nearly 50 hour weeks is definitely a condemnation. Add to that the fact that situations were often worsened considerably, instead of de-escalated, by the inclusion of the managers/owners input made me feel unsafe working there on numerous occasions. Several other employees were given anxiety attacks due to the exploits of the managers/owners, leading to the point that I was the only employee currently working for them across ALL of their stores (the rest were family members). I am scheduled to be shuttled off to a much smaller, failing store to work due to their apparent want to get me to quit, even when my car is shared between multiple people and me traveling sizable distances mean that one of us cannot get to work.

The ethics and management approach to Macondo Well disaster is indicative of how this company runs day to day. This company always operates in the grey area of ethics. The attitude is not what is right, but what can we get away with and what will it cost if we get caught. Most of the top talent leaves after vesting because of the toxic atmosphere. This is a company living in the old world of cronyism. It is not what you know, but who you know.
