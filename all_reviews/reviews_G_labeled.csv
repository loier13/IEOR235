2910;2910;In San Antonio, one of the better employers in terms of salaries and benefits (certainly not the best in my opinion). Health and fitness is part of Valero culture. It's implicitly understood that all the employees will be out for a workout during lunch hours. Post lunch meetings are usually scheduled keeping this in mind. It offers great work life balance. It has relaxed the dressing code in recent years. The IT team is of a medium size. Almost everyone is busy with one project after another. Valero is a big SAP client. It leverages a lot out from SAP. There is lot of interesting work, but it does have some mundane stuff that needs to be taken care of as well. Valero is a safe company to work with. Its business model is conservative and mitigates risk. Moreover it is the industry leader in the refining field. It does not lay off employees.. ;0;0.0

I really loved that chevron and my manager were able to work with my school schedule no matter what it was. They understood that school was my priority. Not only did they help with my schedule but they also paid 75% of my tuition (limit per year). The company really cares for their employees and all kinds of bosses come to see the store. I've met the president of Chevron (not many companies take the time to meet their workers). They offer so many resources and opportunities for employees. Even the DO's for my area were amazing. Chevron was just such a caring company. AND I love and miss their health care and there 401 K benefit. (after writing the review I'm considering going back). ;0;0.0

8212;8212;BP is a large company, and tries to be one with good values. In the past BP was a company where a strong meritocracy culture prevailed.

They provide opportunity for travel, training, life time mentors, performance awards up to Global Helios including networking with thousands of employees and suppliers. Looking back...my experience gained from working at BP after working in many channels of trade all over the globe was one of the best experiences I could have truly ever have ever earned in the work place. I know what it is like to be a lucky full time employee working at BP, politics including all the pros and cons mentioned. These are all great rants and raves and I heard them all looking out. Pre Spill, Pre sale of EOR retail, I mistakenly accepted a position through a widely known recruiting agency with another East Coast American fortune 500 global energy company for more money. Since that day in 2006 I realized the true value and see the big picture of being part of one of the largest companies in the world. My two cents as a former employee … If you have a career shift in any light outside of BP, then you will most likely find value of the time you spent at BP is not necessarily a waste, but rather simply another part of your new journey. In a sense, you may look back every now and then and say; “You don’t know what want till it’s gone”. I feel the lucky full time BP employees may have the last of good jobs/careers left in U.S.A..

281;707;"-The people. As with any workplace, there are people who have either a highly positive or negative attitude. I loved working with many of my coworkers and managers. They were some of the best that I have experienced. Some coworkers are also the most toxic I have ever experienced. This job tends to bring out the two extremes in people, more so than other jobs. The camaraderie between shift workers can be highly rewarding, and form lifelong friends, or extremely toxic depending on how you make it, and how your colleagues make it.. . . -Well paying if you are hired as a permanent employee. If you can find a union position then the pay is significantly higher than you would find for equivalent job roles outside of an oil refinery. Overtime pay adds up quickly and can be substantial. But the high pay comes at a price. Many coworkers who have worked for this company for 25+ years describe the pay as a ""golden cage"" (more on that below). . -Highly Professional approach to safety and industry best practices. Every single day we had a safety meeting to brief the team on possible hazards and precautions needed for best practice. This is possibly the single most positive skill I took with me from this company to another industry. Many other companies in other industries will not have the same high standards for safety the the Oil Industry has. It can be a dangerous job and as such the company holds the highest standards possible for safety and professionalism. There is zero tolerance for unsafe work practices.. . . -wide range of technical and practical hands-on skills and training which you can learn. . -It doesn't get much ""bigger"" than ""Big Oil"", almost any other company you join afterwards will not be dealing with volume or throughput quantities as large as Big Oil. Think small margin, high volume. It is high stakes. When you make a small mistake, it can affect tens of thousands of gallons of product. Efficiency is key. This is valuable experience moving to another industry.. . -Pro/Con, there is a high standard for consistency and professionalism in the company. The oil refinery produces an unfathomable amount of product every single hour of every single day. When you make a mistake, it could affect tens of thousands of gallons of product. Management is generally practical and understanding most of the time but not always. Mistakes happen, but generally they emphasize learning and growing from the mistakes. Sometimes, this is not the case and management can be toxic. Nevertheless, it can be stressful being in a routine high-pressure position knowing your mistake could have an immediate impact on thousands of gallons of product.. ";1;

287;730;pay, benefits, people, culture, rotation. ;1;
288;731;Great Benefits. High Pay . Excellent Training. ;1;
289;734;"Compensation packages are exceptional. Base salaries may not be on par with Google, but additional benefits add up fast. Bonuses are usually 10% and often better, up to 25% of base. Stock options (Restricted Stock Units, or RSUs) are awarded twice a year (the target varies, but so long as the company is doing well, the target is usually exceeded). The company offers a dollar-for-dollar match on 401k contributions worth up to 6% of your base salary, which is outrageously high for the private sector. And on top of that, P66 has the white rhino of private sector benefits: a pension, and it vests after just 3 years at the company. Additionally, that pension plan includes more stock options, called ""Success Shares"" that are dropped into your retirement account based on the overall performance of the business. Altogether, these financial benefits can easily be valued at 50% of your base salary, and the longer you stay, the better it gets. With the exception of refineries in New Jersey and California, most offices and facilities are in relatively low-tax, low-cost-of-living locations (especially HQ in Texas, a state with no personal income tax). . . Since the company is situated in the ""midstream"" (pipelines) and ""downstream"" (refineries, retail) segments of the energy industry, its stock price isn't heavily dependent on the price of oil; it's a company that takes oil & gas in, and then sends it back out as a new product, taking a relatively consistent margin all the time. This protects the firm's value - and therefore the value of your RSUs - against most market volatility. . . Yes, the company loves to talk up its employee-centric culture. But they back that up by comping people fairly well. It's the kind of chatter that I've heard before at other places, but it always sounded hollow when your sole benefit was something like a 2% match on 401k.. ";1;

But let's be honest; CoP fits the norm with the rest of the oil and gas industry good paying jobs and benefits. There is a common comment that there is good work life balance. I agree as this is the case for most teams and employees. The norm for a team is to have an abundance of team members which many get used to being able to take 1.5 hour lunches and leave work before 5pm. This is made possible by having too many employees on low activity teams, with certain select employees or teams do the majority of the work.. ";1;
383;1068;Great benefits. Great pay. Met multiple good people.. ;1;
384;1072;Great pay, great vacation and great experience.. ;1;

387;1081;Great Company pay, benefits and you learn as you go.. ;1;
388;1083;Very good pay/benefits. In Oklahoma market, it is quite hard to beat. The work is also not too stressful as cutbacks have caused lots of projects to get turned down.. ;1;

392;1093;Great Benefits and pay including Pension and 401k. ;1;

398;1109;COP is generally a good place to work that promotes from within. If you stick around, they will give you opportunities that maybe would be unlikely elsewhere. If you want to have a career here with the potential to move through different job assignments, it is possible.

441;1280;Benefits are great (though rumor has it that they may be changing) and pay is pretty good too (though a bit lower than other independent companies). Culture was great, though low-commodity pricing has lowered employee morale and the way employees truly used to care for one another (people do crazy things just to keep the job).. ;1;

I was able to work on interesting things and on projects that had an impact on the company bottom line. Would get 'rewarded' with high ratings for hard work on important projects. Work / Life balance in my office location was great. The gym facilities were pretty great too, and I liked that they were open a lot.

471;1420;The company culture, values, and benefits are first class. They treat all employees well and really value their people. They have done a good job at staying competitive with the industry and also have listened to the employee opinions when deciding on corporate wide changes. Ryan Lance (CEO) is a good leader and has made some much needed changes.. ;1;
472;1422;Great pay, best 401(k) plan in the nation, amazing gym, ~40 hrs/week is normal and expected for everyone. ;1;

479;1437;Treat employees fairly, good benifits. ;1;
480;1450;The pay is pretty good. Benefits (health insurance, bonuses, pension, etc.) are decent.

489;1474;Good people, fair benefits, many career opportunities. ;1;
490;1475;Good Pay, time off and sometimes profit sharing. Pay raises most years, benefits are established for local areas.. ;1;
491;1481;- New CEO Ryan Lance seems like he cares more for his employees than Mulva did. (example: he did away with Mulva's joke of a forced rankings system) (example: he recently raised the bonus target rate for certain salary grades.) - Good retirement (although not as good as Devon's) and health benefits/insurance. - 19/30 days (work an extra 30 minutes each day and get one day off a month & doesn't count against vacation days) - Good work/life balance. ;1;
492;1482;Good pay and benefits. Reasonable concern for the welfare of employees. Intelligent, skilled workforce. ;1;
493;1483;pay good, people good, benefits good, vacation good... Quite a few quality managers but competition is fierce for positions associated with the quality managers. The career path for college new hires is extraordinary. For good or bad, family atmosphere. Opportunities to move to Houston after a few years in Bartlesville is the biggest incentive to accept a position in Bartlesville.. ;1;
494;1490;Good pay if your well liked. ;1;
495;1494;Great road map to develop career, fair in assessments, great compensation, great values. ;1;

497;1497;Opportunity for international experience Excellent training opportunities (depends on business unit) Opportunity to work on mega projects (>$1 B dollars) Competitive base salary Good safety culture. ;1;
498;1500;The company expects certain basic things of their employees such as being on time, not leaving early, and working safe. In exchange for these few things, they give you a generous benefits package, a decent salary, company savings plan, matching stock package, and many other perks. The company also supports employees participating in community service activities and makes provisions for you to serve the community during regular work hours with pay.. ;1;
499;1501;This is a stable company with a stable stock price and good benefits. Lots of opportunity for challenging work and global opportunities.. ;1;
500;1505;Interesting processes and equipment Good contract and in-house union workforce Free safety glasses Free safety shoes Free nomex Steady paycheck On-site cafereria Air conditioned and heated offices. ;1;
501;1509;Good pay. Intern program is alright. Could've been much better, but the Finance and IT interns had it much better since they had a good HR manager. You get to meet a lot of people through Lunch n Learns. The problem is, the interns started separating a bit, with the finance group hanging with themselves, procurement with themselves, etc. Yet there were a fair number of interns who organized and attended social events outside of work hours.. ;1;
502;1512;compensation is fair. Schedule is great.. ;1;
503;1514;#NOM?;1;
504;1515;Good pay and decent benefits. Could be much better on medical benefits. Interesting work with daily challenges. Excellent union workforce.. ;1;

507;1524;Good Pay Good Benefits Managers are flexible Great Houston campus with a nice gym and soccer field 19/30s are a big plus. ;1;
508;1527;Managers and co-workers are very nice and helpful, the work environment is friendly. Their pay and benefits are above average level.. ;1;
509;1528;Open environment where you can ask quesions Unlimited training modules to help in development Lots of seasoned employees willing to share and help Great amount of inconsistent business practices that allow employees unlimited opportunities to deliver results & make their mark Lean and mean Not a lot of layers Good visibility to leadership and upper management. ;1;
510;1539;Very friendly people and great company culture. Lots of opportunities within the procurement department. Very competitive pay. ;1;
511;1540;"Stability; Benefits; Professional support; Work-Life Balance. The employees at CPAI are a very close-knit group and very collegial.. ";1;
512;1541;Pay is high. Really good people that know what to do and are willing to help. It is really safe and a good environment to work.. ;1;
513;1552;Lots of opportunities for change (not necessarily advancement), due to the size of the company. Good pay and great benefits compared to other industries. Relatively secure compared to more cut throat industries. If you are the kind of person who just wants to coast until retirement with decent pay and benefits this may be the place.. ;1;
514;1554;good pay, challenging work, centralized down town location, tunnels to work protect one from the elements, flying to houston on the corporate jet is cool. ;1;
515;1555;I've developed lifelong friendships with many colleagues. My pay check is deposited on time twice a month. The fitness center is very nice and an overpriced coffee bar is available to those that can't stomach the coffee like substance dispensed in the break rooms. The cafeteria at the Houston HQ is good. Cafeterias at other locations are lacking.. ;1;
516;1572;Good benefits, flextime, great pay, and the people are all very easy to get along with. It is definitely a place you will love or hate. Everyone that I came in contact with treated me as a coworker and not as in intern. I was also given a real task, which was a big deal to me. I did not want to get coffee for people are summer long, regardless of pay. Conoco puts a strong emphasis on not encroaching into your personal time, so you don't have to worry about working at home.. ;1;
517;1575;Pay is pretty good compaired to other companies. The work is reasonable for the pay and they offer the normal package of incentives, health insurance, 401K etc. Like the military there is two groups, officers and enlisted or hourerly and salary. Most of the time it seems we work against each other all the while promoting team work. All of the hourly work in a very tight team work organization but are often interupted by management (salaried) to do some bonehead idea. Unfortunately there is no oversight on them so no matter how bad they mess up they keep their job. Hourly not so much, mess up too much and your gone.. ;1;
518;1576;Stability. Money is alright as well.. ;1;
519;1579;It is a large reputable company which is more stable than many of the smaller independents oil and gas companies. ;1;
520;1581;Good growth opportunities, good salaries, safety, fairness. ;1;
521;1586;It is a good time to start your career with COP. There is a large population that is nearing retirement so there will be plenty of opportunities for career advancement. The pay is very competitive and the benefits are generally pretty good too. There is no shortage of work, so if you like to be busy then you should look at this company. There are a lot of highly skilled folks that generally like to engage the younger workforce and assist in their development - which is a big plus. There is also a lot of construction activity going on at my site so you can be pretty confident about career longevity and job security.. ;1;
522;1589;OK pay & benefits - most of the managers I've had have been easy to get along with. ;1;
523;1594;Dynamic energy company with lots of growth opportunities. It seems like there are always new jobs posted on the internal web site. Headquarters in an easy-to-get-to Houston location, not in downtown. Benefits are fair, especially when it comes to retirement and savings -- pension, 401k and stock thrift are hard to beat. Salaries may be slightly lower than average.. ;1;
524;1595;"The people at ConocoPhillips are great to work with. You don't feel like you're just a number. At most companies, you feel like there are revolving doors with people constantly leaving, but that is not the case here. If you're in the finance or most other aspects of the company, you don't have to live in the ""big"" city for your ""big break."" There are plenty opportunities right here in Bartlesville and it's a good place to raise children and have a family. Higher ranking officers from the corporate office even drop by to your office from time to time and come to each person's individual desk to talk to you to get feedback. On top of all that, the company has GREAT PAY and WONDERFUL BENEFITS. The company is always looking for more ways to improve and satisfy its employees. So far, it has been a great company to work for.. ";1;
525;1597;Compensation is good. Locations around the world. Some chance for advancement. Company is making lots of money - as long as the government keeps their hands out of it. Lots of good people. If you are a hard worker you will be compensated well. If you are an average worker you will still be overpaid. If you're a louzy worker they will keep you around anyway. Once your on the payroll it is hard to get rid of people. Have some good locations to work at. Big city (Houston) or smaller towns (Farmington NM). Great variety. Bigger office have good work out facilities.. ;1;
526;1602;A very good place to work with systematic outlines and procedures to follow. Good work life balance. Good Team.. ;1;
527;1606;Long career prospects Reasonable work life balance International opportunities Reasonable pay and compensation Well organised and professionally run Capable workforce. ;1;

544;1690;I am a Bachelor of Economic Accounting. I really want to work at this part such as Administration and Finance. ;1;
545;1694;There is a very high percentage of good honest people working here. Thankfully there are not very many a**holes and that attitude is generally not tolerated. There are good holidays, good pay (though now stagnated). The hours have certainly become longer since they halved the workforce. But there are rarely people shouting at you to get stuff down. Relaxed working environment. If you were married with a mortgage and modest ambitions, this would be a good place to while away the years.. ;1;

899;3289;"This review is for engineering within Distribution. Transmission/Nuclear/etc. need not worry about ever having any real issues, as they get to mostly stay away from customers. - the paycheck never bounced - OK starting vacation hours, until you quickly realized its never enough to get you away from the wretched place along with permanently never being able to catch up with work projects - place does give out an actual bonus around mid-March, though the percentage you get stems from some questionable in-house statistics... - surprisingly OK healthcare options, although that leads into a con of you automatically get enrolled with their base healthcare option UNLESS you purposely elect to not take their healthcare option. Makes sense? Not at Duke. - An assortment of coworkers who are always ready and willing to share the misery with you, because everyone eventually realizes what a dead-end being in engineering in Distribution really is. Unless brown is the favorite color to paint your nose with! - Discounts that are either only marginally useful or only helpful if you're in certain locations. Better luck next time if you're stuck in a small office and can't transfer with the ""good ole boys"" in Charlotte! - I've heard it's a good name to have on the resume, but I'm ready to be able to permanently take it off the resume in a couple years. - Remote working was a useful option, but it quickly turns into a con once you realize it actually means they expect you to be able to respond to inquiries/update projects 24/7. Turns your home space into a dystopian nightmare once you open up the laptop/work phone and see you missed several calls for inane questions that you will never be able to catch up on. - ""Flexible"" hours, not a very set schedule but that seems to be office-dependent. Also feeds into the ""pro"" above with the remote work option, hidden expectation to always be ready 24/7. - The best pro is when you leave the dead-end line of work this really is, and realize there is more to life than bending at the knee to needy demanding people who will never be satisfied no matter how efficient and correct your work is. Does feed into the last pro though... - Best pro lesson learned here, is how to prioritize. Time management is not an actual concept you can ever embrace here due to how inefficient both the company and clients are as a whole but learning to prioritize will save your sanity. You quickly learn that project efficiency and cost-effectiveness + long term reliability and safety are the ways to go, not bending over for the crying client who thinks touting that they've ""put up with Duke for over 30 years"" and ""I've never had to provide this in my life for these projects until now"" are going to do anything for them. Management sees that in reverse order though, as you will continuously find out in your simulated prison sentence masquerading as the Distribution engineering department.. ";1;

943;3428;Great Pay and Good Benefits. ;1;
944;3433;"Pay & Benefits Are Satisfactory. The beach and major amenities are nearby and the cost of living is rather low. Plenty of ""opportunities"" to succeed. For engineering: for the most part documentation is strong making information relatively trivial to find. Engineering management is very good and fair. Many meals are comp'd by the company which definitely shows the company is showing us we are worthwhile. They also have an amazing relocation package (there are significant cons to it, see cons).. ";1;
945;3434;challenge, training, advancement, pay, benefits. ;1;
946;3442;Unlimited overtime and sales commission. This company would pay $10 per person you setup on load control for resident's heating and cooling systems. Also you could get 80 hours of PTO and 80 hours of sick time upfront. They would also contribute $500 a year to your healthcare spending card.. ;1;
947;3444;pay is great. they really focus on education and do all they can to get you the education needed. great benefits. always changing. keeps you on your toes and helps you grow.. ;1;
948;3445;Co-workers are awesome, the pay is awesome, free food sometimes. Get the opportunity to make extra money selling certain products within a call. Bonuses quarterly and yearly .. ;1;
949;3448;Amazing coworker relationships, very family like. Good pay. Good benefits. I’ve worked places where it was a fight to get out of bed to show up, this isn’t one of those places. I’d caution others considering applying to remember complaints are a matter of perception. I would absolutely recommend this company. Great schedule options. ;1;
950;3451;Great environment, great team. I had a great experience with my peers and the business groups I supported. The BAs and dev team was tightly integrated which made a great recipe for success in delivering successful projects. Great benefits. Although I did later find out I was being paid a decent amount less than the pay band I was on and jobs for similar positions in the area were much higher.. ;1;
951;3454;The company is taking steps to faithfully serve the rate payers. This amounts to making changes to the mix of energy sources and how they are operated, turning greener and meaner. This means a few things to me, more natural gas power plants and more renewables, but also lots of cost cutting efforts. I feel that Duke Energy is taking the right steps when considering the customers, employees, and public.. ;1;
952;3456;Tuition Reimbursement, Good selection of schedules, decent pay, lots of overtime, sales, emloyees in other centers are friendly. ;1;
953;3457;Decent pay for a rural community, good benefits, great community involvement funds. Some paid travel to head quarters in Charlotte. Very Safety minded.

This position has a flexible schedule, good work life balance.. ;1;
954;3462;Benefits package, growth opportunities, stable company that's involved in the community, corporate partnerships get you discounts on travel, cellular bills, rental cars, etc., very uncommon to get fired.. ;1;
955;3464;Pay and bonuses are excellent. Decent medical/dental/vision coverage.. ;1;
956;3465;Employees are generally friendly, which helped offset the stressful work environment and long hours. Pay, medical benefits, and PTO are competitive for the market.. ;1;
957;3467;You never have to worry about the company's services not being needed anymore as everyone needs power to function in today's world. The population of the work force is more like family than coworkers. Everyone cares about everyone else and their ability to make it home safe to their family at the end of the day. The benefits packages are out of this world witht he company matching more than most do for retirement 401K accounts. Wonderful vacation and pay raise scales keep you from being left behind on the money train. Overal, I have been there more than a decade and nothing major to complain about yet.. ;1;
958;3471;Pay is great, benifits continue to decline away to about nothing. not to many positives with the new Duke. It was a much better company to work for when we were Progress Energy and before that Florida Power. There was at least family values within the ranks. Now it's 100% business.. ;1;
959;3472;Duke Energy is a great place to work. I believe there really is a genuine interest in doing the right thing and treating employees and customer fairly, honestly and ethically.. ;1;

1587;6643;For a chemical or mechanical engineer, you'll get to fully use your education. Entry-level pay is strong versus competitors, the work is challenging, and developmental opportunities are robust. In fact, the executives themselves managed to climb the ladder from the ranks of the engineers so theoretically you can make it to the very top. Employee investment is very front-loaded towards new hires, both in terms of technical training as well as business acumen training. Bonuses are good at Chevron and there's still a pension which is increasingly atypical of employers these days. There are opportunities to develop skills which are valuable outside of Chevron. Take advantage of these. The Data Science and Lean Sigma programs are very underutilized and can make you valuable outside the lumbering dinosaur of Oil & Gas.. ;1;

1650;6861;The benefits package at Chevron is literally unmatched in any other company or industry that I have seen. I had good managers and bad managers while there. There is mobility there and opportunity there, but they base this on a two year life-cycle which is not ideal in some cases. They put a high regard on development and have a well developed self-improvement program. Chevron has a very specific culture which can either be a good thing or a bad thing. I found the culture rewarding in that it strongly focuses on safety and health, but I also found it annoying in some ways for those exact same reasons. It is hard to describe until you are in the midst of it. But Chevron has a strong culture, and they take it seriously. Most organizations I've been with pay lip-service to their culture, Chevron does not--their culture is taken seriously. Working in IT, I've never experience a good work/life balance in my career, however Chevron has been the best company I've worked at to date for this balance.. ;1;

It allows for flexible work hours and it truly does try to provide for a balance between personal and work life.. ;1;
2011;8246;"Actually if you work hard and are unrelenting in accomplishing your job, this place has fairly decent opportunities. Management will at least act like they are listening to you. Management won’t fly of the handle and scream or lose their cool very often, if ever. The company is getting its VPP (variable pay for performance) package to be fairer in rewarding those who work hard and consistently. Hourly people can get a VPP in four different brackets; (a.) under expectations=0% bonus, (b.) meets expectations=7% bonus, (c.) exceeds expectations=17.5% bonus, (d.) exceptional=21% bonus. It is a little more complex than that but, not much and it is pretty fair in a lot of ways. They match 401k at 7%, administered through Fidelity. The overall resources for work /life balance are pretty great considering the size of the company. I get four forty hour weeks paid vacation every year, but I work 84 hour weeks offshore so I really get two offshore weeks off every year. They pay $250 towards fitness equipment for you to buy for your home uses every year, plus $300 for participating in other health initiatives through BPhit program. So, I can have six weeks in a row off every year without missing my base check. Nice. You won’t ever be harassed for taking the time to do the job safely or environmentally friendly. They do have mechanisms in place to report unethical management practices so that you have a form of recourse if they want you to take unnecessary chances or risks. I appreciate the fact that even if they are truly at heart an oil company, they are taking steps to create a greener company. Overall, I am pretty happy with the company, for what it is and what industry it is in.. ";1;
