4191;4191;"Let's get real. YES, Enterprise is a giant corporation. YES, sometimes the corporate office is a meat grinder. YES, sometimes management is hard on you. YES, there are communications breakdowns across groups...blah blah blah. But let's get real, what major corporation doesn't have these issues?? You adapt and overcome and get on with it...Here's what I will say about my experience with Enterprise (and yes, I realize that there could be [read: are] others having wildly different experiences based on location, direct management, position, et al); in my experience if you show up hungry every day, work hard, learn something, and stay focused you will advance and you will be compensated for it. It sounds overly cliché, but it's not. I've had several managers both in operations and in commercial, some (ok one) of them very difficult, but I was still advanced and continued to receive merit increases because I refused to give in to the temptation of complacency. The culture of Enterprise is such that actual hard work, team-building and dedication will be rewarded, and nay-saying, laziness and complacency will stick out like a sore thumb. Cliché or not, that's what I've experienced, and there's my two cents.. ";0;0.0

4201;4201;"- The People - One of the best aspects of working at Enterprise was the people you interact with on a daily basis.

This makes it much easier to do your job as a member of the team at the corporate office. - Bonuses - Once you get into the bonus pool, the LTIP and STIP are both very competitive.. ";0;0.0

219;707;"-The people. As with any workplace, there are people who have either a highly positive or negative attitude. I loved working with many of my coworkers and managers. They were some of the best that I have experienced. Some coworkers are also the most toxic I have ever experienced. This job tends to bring out the two extremes in people, more so than other jobs. The camaraderie between shift workers can be highly rewarding, and form lifelong friends, or extremely toxic depending on how you make it, and how your colleagues make it.. . . -Well paying if you are hired as a permanent employee. If you can find a union position then the pay is significantly higher than you would find for equivalent job roles outside of an oil refinery. Overtime pay adds up quickly and can be substantial. But the high pay comes at a price. Many coworkers who have worked for this company for 25+ years describe the pay as a ""golden cage"" (more on that below). . -Highly Professional approach to safety and industry best practices. Every single day we had a safety meeting to brief the team on possible hazards and precautions needed for best practice. This is possibly the single most positive skill I took with me from this company to another industry. Many other companies in other industries will not have the same high standards for safety the the Oil Industry has. It can be a dangerous job and as such the company holds the highest standards possible for safety and professionalism. There is zero tolerance for unsafe work practices.. . . -wide range of technical and practical hands-on skills and training which you can learn. . -It doesn't get much ""bigger"" than ""Big Oil"", almost any other company you join afterwards will not be dealing with volume or throughput quantities as large as Big Oil. Think small margin, high volume. It is high stakes. When you make a small mistake, it can affect tens of thousands of gallons of product. Efficiency is key. This is valuable experience moving to another industry.. . -Pro/Con, there is a high standard for consistency and professionalism in the company. The oil refinery produces an unfathomable amount of product every single hour of every single day. When you make a mistake, it could affect tens of thousands of gallons of product. Management is generally practical and understanding most of the time but not always. Mistakes happen, but generally they emphasize learning and growing from the mistakes. Sometimes, this is not the case and management can be toxic. Nevertheless, it can be stressful being in a routine high-pressure position knowing your mistake could have an immediate impact on thousands of gallons of product.. ";1;
220;709;Great benefits and compensation. Good values for individual success and career development. Great culture and overall a positive place to work.. ;1;
221;710;Work life balance and somewhat job security. ;1;
222;711;good, work and life balance. ;1;
223;713;The benefits are great. Lots of opportunities to get into different fields in the company. Phillips 66 will pay for your CPA study materials and reimburse you for all 4 parts of your CPA exam! The best part is you don’t have to have a CPA to be an accountant with this company. Wonderful team atmosphere with management that supports your goals.. ;1;

227;727;Great benefits, safe work environment. ;1;
228;734;"Compensation packages are exceptional. Base salaries may not be on par with Google, but additional benefits add up fast. Bonuses are usually 10% and often better, up to 25% of base. Stock options (Restricted Stock Units, or RSUs) are awarded twice a year (the target varies, but so long as the company is doing well, the target is usually exceeded). The company offers a dollar-for-dollar match on 401k contributions worth up to 6% of your base salary, which is outrageously high for the private sector. And on top of that, P66 has the white rhino of private sector benefits: a pension, and it vests after just 3 years at the company. Additionally, that pension plan includes more stock options, called ""Success Shares"" that are dropped into your retirement account based on the overall performance of the business. Altogether, these financial benefits can easily be valued at 50% of your base salary, and the longer you stay, the better it gets. With the exception of refineries in New Jersey and California, most offices and facilities are in relatively low-tax, low-cost-of-living locations (especially HQ in Texas, a state with no personal income tax). . . Since the company is situated in the ""midstream"" (pipelines) and ""downstream"" (refineries, retail) segments of the energy industry, its stock price isn't heavily dependent on the price of oil; it's a company that takes oil & gas in, and then sends it back out as a new product, taking a relatively consistent margin all the time. This protects the firm's value - and therefore the value of your RSUs - against most market volatility. . . Yes, the company loves to talk up its employee-centric culture. But they back that up by comping people fairly well. It's the kind of chatter that I've heard before at other places, but it always sounded hollow when your sole benefit was something like a 2% match on 401k.. ";1;
229;738;"Benefits are robust and competitive; gorgeous HQ building with many amenities, employees are warm and supportive, strong vision from CEO and executive leadership; very strong safety culture. ";1;

336;1066;"The company has strong heritage assets, and may kind caring people. There are many smart talented people. However, overarching corporate vision and smart business decision making are lacking. The work scheduling with every other friday off schedule is fantastic. I also never found it a problem to get away for doctors visits or any sudden family needs. The Houston campus is beautiful, and has excellent exercise facilities and gym staff. Compensation is great. But let's be honest; CoP fits the norm with the rest of the oil and gas industry good paying jobs and benefits. There is a common comment that there is good work life balance. I agree as this is the case for most teams and employees. The norm for a team is to have an abundance of team members which many get used to being able to take 1.5 hour lunches and leave work before 5pm. This is made possible by having too many employees on low activity teams, with certain select employees or teams do the majority of the work.. ";1;
337;1069;"Benefits are definitely great; few companies still offer pension plans nowadays. Access to technology (SME's and software) is one of the major pros for working at a large E&P. Focus on safety culture is genuine by most employees. ";1;

347;1094;The pay is good. They treat their employees well, at least when commodity prices are high. When ConocoPhillips was an integrated oil company, there were opportunities to do a wide variety of work all over the world including upstream, downstream, and midstream.. ;1;

350;1107;Great work environment, safety is the top priority, which is great! They staff up when times are good.. ;1;
351;1108;The company generally treats its employees very well. The benefits are the best that I have seen anywhere. Management seems to truly care about the well being of employees. Most of the employees are smart and wonderful to work with. There is lots of opportunity for advancement.. ;1;
352;1109;COP is generally a good place to work that promotes from within. If you stick around, they will give you opportunities that maybe would be unlikely elsewhere. If you want to have a career here with the potential to move through different job assignments, it is possible. Corporate culture is positive, it seems that people here generally care about you, benefits are industry competitive. Good location in Energy Corridor, beautiful complex, and great onsite gym, medical and dental clinics, cafeteria.. ;1;
353;1110;COP gets it on how to treat people with a positive work culture and 9/80 worklife balance days. Solid leadership in place to help navigate through current economic challenges. Cares about employee development.. ;1;

During my entire career I firmly believed in their safety motto and that fact that they understood, even for a very large company that ""employees"" were their most valuable asset. There are always exceptions but at COPC it was an exception, not the rule. Even when hard choices had to be made, My opinion was employees who added value and worked hard were retained or released whith their interest in mind.. ";1;
365;1141;Good Benefits and great work/life balance. ;1;

369;1153;Work life balance is strong. ;1;
370;1159;This company really cares about your career development and personal growth, more than I've seen anywhere else. New hires go through a rotation program in which they change their job every 15 months or so. This gives exposure to different types of jobs and the ability to learn significantly more skills as a result. The people are super friendly and everyone is supportive of each other's success. ;1;
371;1161;Good benefits, flexible work schedule, good salaries, career development opportunities, good working environment, nice offices and installations.. ;1;
372;1162;Focused on margins and reality of lower for longer market outlook. Opportunities abound for cost conscious individual. Still a major independent operator.. ;1;

374;1164;ConocoPhillips is a good company to work for if you are going to be in the Oil and Gas Business. Most people I have worked for in the company care about their employees and they do what they can for them. The remuneration packages are good, and when prices are high there is a huge amount of opportunity.. ;1;
375;1166;Good overall compensation an work life balance. ;1;
376;1167;If you move around internally enough you'll land on a good team. Some teams have extremely bad management that micromanage and kill any innovation. My last team was awesome. We all loved our jobs and got exposure to numerous technology stacks.. ;1;

404;1247;Incredible benefits. Arguably the best you'll find. Tons of inward mobility opportunities and training offered.. ;1;

413;1280;Benefits are great (though rumor has it that they may be changing) and pay is pretty good too (though a bit lower than other independent companies). Culture was great, though low-commodity pricing has lowered employee morale and the way employees truly used to care for one another (people do crazy things just to keep the job).. ;1;
414;1282;Great Benefits, Great Pay and a well engage management team. You get every other Friday off from work. So the work life balance is amazing.. ;1;
415;1283;Good salary, benefits, work life balance. All of this is a sham when the oil price is low however as it is unsustainable.. ;1;
416;1287;Great benefits and amazing encouragement to stay healthy and active. ;1;
417;1291;Good working environment in the office. Management treats you as an adult and isn't constantly looking over your shoulder to monitor your work.. ;1;

As an engineer, if you were willing to be coached/taught and work hard there was lots of opportunity to develop professionally. Post-Spin Off - Moved to a more progressive benefits package and work environment. Noticed more women & young people in leadership roles and an employee friendly work environment for salaried employees. At the time, $$ was available for internal and external training. **Noticed some complaints were regarding ""location"".

486;1450;The pay is pretty good. Benefits (health insurance, bonuses, pension, etc.) are decent. If you are an engineer or geologist, you get better incentives than other functions (restricted stocks, etc). The company has 9/80s, which means some people get every other Friday off (but not everybody).. ;1;
487;1454;Easy access to management. Lots of incentives to work hard. Younger culture is starting to take hold. Good Benefits. I interned here several times before graduating and accepting an offer.

This could mean leaving your current role and getting out of your comfort zone; but they are willing to train you if you show the aptitude and desire.. ";1;
503;1481;- New CEO Ryan Lance seems like he cares more for his employees than Mulva did. (example: he did away with Mulva's joke of a forced rankings system) (example: he recently raised the bonus target rate for certain salary grades.) - Good retirement (although not as good as Devon's) and health benefits/insurance. - 19/30 days (work an extra 30 minutes each day and get one day off a month & doesn't count against vacation days) - Good work/life balance. ;1;
504;1483;pay good, people good, benefits good, vacation good... Quite a few quality managers but competition is fierce for positions associated with the quality managers.

537;1552;Lots of opportunities for change (not necessarily advancement), due to the size of the company. Good pay and great benefits compared to other industries. Relatively secure compared to more cut throat industries. If you are the kind of person who just wants to coast until retirement with decent pay and benefits this may be the place.. ;1;
538;1555;I've developed lifelong friendships with many colleagues. My pay check is deposited on time twice a month. The fitness center is very nice and an overpriced coffee bar is available to those that can't stomach the coffee like substance dispensed in the break rooms. The cafeteria at the Houston HQ is good. Cafeterias at other locations are lacking.. ;1;
539;1563;Knowledge sharing is common, which makes it is a great place to learn from more experienced colleagues. People are friendly and open. There are lots of opportunities within the company because of its size, but it is not overly bureaucratic as some large organizations become. Large company opportunities with small company values.. ;1;
540;1564;The internship program was very organized with networking opportunities, social events, and so forth. You get to work on 1 project. Everyone is quite friendly and helpful.. ;1;

546;1574;The people at ConocoPhillips are very friendly and willing to help others out. They offer a lot of opportunities to individuals that are just coming out of college. There are many ways to learn more about the industry and see whether or not it is a good fit. ConocoPhillips also has great compensation and everyone seems to be very excited to work there. You are constantly challenged to apply everything you have learned into your work and have the guidance of the other employees. Overall, I would definitely recommend individuals to look at this company and consider it as an option.. ;1;
547;1575;Pay is pretty good compaired to other companies. The work is reasonable for the pay and they offer the normal package of incentives, health insurance, 401K etc. Like the military there is two groups, officers and enlisted or hourerly and salary. Most of the time it seems we work against each other all the while promoting team work. All of the hourly work in a very tight team work organization but are often interupted by management (salaried) to do some bonehead idea. Unfortunately there is no oversight on them so no matter how bad they mess up they keep their job. Hourly not so much, mess up too much and your gone.. ;1;
548;1581;Good growth opportunities, good salaries, safety, fairness. ;1;
549;1583;Highly ethical company with great people and opportunities if you are a hard worker who is committed to the company's success.. ;1;

551;1585;Employee friendly. Great opportunities including on the job and personal development. Nice amenities and office atmosphere.. ;1;
552;1586;It is a good time to start your career with COP. There is a large population that is nearing retirement so there will be plenty of opportunities for career advancement. The pay is very competitive and the benefits are generally pretty good too. There is no shortage of work, so if you like to be busy then you should look at this company.

983;2910;In San Antonio, one of the better employers in terms of salaries and benefits (certainly not the best in my opinion). Health and fitness is part of Valero culture. It's implicitly understood that all the employees will be out for a workout during lunch hours. Post lunch meetings are usually scheduled keeping this in mind. It offers great work life balance. It has relaxed the dressing code in recent years. The IT team is of a medium size. Almost everyone is busy with one project after another. Valero is a big SAP client. It leverages a lot out from SAP. There is lot of interesting work, but it does have some mundane stuff that needs to be taken care of as well. Valero is a safe company to work with. Its business model is conservative and mitigates risk. Moreover it is the industry leader in the refining field. It does not lay off employees.. ;1;
984;2911;Great benefits, dr on-site, gym, day care and cafeteria. ;1;
985;2912;Best place to work because: you have the opportunity to help others, the community you work in, your co-workers treat you with respect, the benefits are very competitive since they help you pay for your benefits, Valero cares about your well-being since they have fitness center, clinic @ head quarters and they provide a Gym subsidy for those not working at head quarters, they also provide a subsidy for day care, they also help you understand how fortunate we all are by being able to donate to many charities, and NO they don't force you to donate!, you decide for yourself how much to contribute, great pension plan, 401k matching, I can keep going on and on how great Valero is! Lastly, you get yo meet the CEO once you are hired, I mean where do you can the chance to meet the CEO, nowhere.. They also provide many charity events for our veterans, children, and many other social events that benefit the community.. ;1;
986;2913;Valero provides an excellent working environment for employees, complete with on-site childcare, doctor, cafeteria, and a fitness center with tennis and basketball courts, and running trails. The company offers a leading employee compensation plan that includes excellent medical coverage options, along with a pension and 401k, among other things.. ;1;

1104;3278;Just what the title says. It's a fun place to work for software development, using the latest cloud technologies with management receptive to fresh ideas, researching, and problem-solving. Software developers are respected. Been here over a year and only asked to work on a Sat once for a big, rare upgrade, never asked to stay late and encouraged to take vacation (3 weeks) as well as take company-paid training. 401K match is 4% then up to 6% matching, which has been great. Can work remotely if I'm sick or have an appointment at home which is nice. Speaking up, collaboration, helping others is highly encouraged.. ;1;
1105;3289;"This review is for engineering within Distribution. Transmission/Nuclear/etc. need not worry about ever having any real issues, as they get to mostly stay away from customers. - the paycheck never bounced - OK starting vacation hours, until you quickly realized its never enough to get you away from the wretched place along with permanently never being able to catch up with work projects - place does give out an actual bonus around mid-March, though the percentage you get stems from some questionable in-house statistics... - surprisingly OK healthcare options, although that leads into a con of you automatically get enrolled with their base healthcare option UNLESS you purposely elect to not take their healthcare option. Makes sense? Not at Duke. - An assortment of coworkers who are always ready and willing to share the misery with you, because everyone eventually realizes what a dead-end being in engineering in Distribution really is. Unless brown is the favorite color to paint your nose with! - Discounts that are either only marginally useful or only helpful if you're in certain locations. Better luck next time if you're stuck in a small office and can't transfer with the ""good ole boys"" in Charlotte! - I've heard it's a good name to have on the resume, but I'm ready to be able to permanently take it off the resume in a couple years. - Remote working was a useful option, but it quickly turns into a con once you realize it actually means they expect you to be able to respond to inquiries/update projects 24/7. Turns your home space into a dystopian nightmare once you open up the laptop/work phone and see you missed several calls for inane questions that you will never be able to catch up on. - ""Flexible"" hours, not a very set schedule but that seems to be office-dependent. Also feeds into the ""pro"" above with the remote work option, hidden expectation to always be ready 24/7. - The best pro is when you leave the dead-end line of work this really is, and realize there is more to life than bending at the knee to needy demanding people who will never be satisfied no matter how efficient and correct your work is. Does feed into the last pro though... - Best pro lesson learned here, is how to prioritize. Time management is not an actual concept you can ever embrace here due to how inefficient both the company and clients are as a whole but learning to prioritize will save your sanity. You quickly learn that project efficiency and cost-effectiveness + long term reliability and safety are the ways to go, not bending over for the crying client who thinks touting that they've ""put up with Duke for over 30 years"" and ""I've never had to provide this in my life for these projects until now"" are going to do anything for them. Management sees that in reverse order though, as you will continuously find out in your simulated prison sentence masquerading as the Distribution engineering department.. ";1;

Duke has been great to work for and has helped me move into better jobs over the years. They paid for my college and gave me the opportunities I needed to make a great career. I started in the union and worked my way into a management position. The aging workforce at Duke will give me and others many more opportunities to work into other interesting jobs over the next few years. The benefits are great too. We enjoy good medical, dental and eye care benefits and a great vacation policy.. ;1;

1388;4191;"Let's get real. YES, Enterprise is a giant corporation. YES, sometimes the corporate office is a meat grinder. YES, sometimes management is hard on you. YES, there are communications breakdowns across groups...blah blah blah. But let's get real, what major corporation doesn't have these issues?? You adapt and overcome and get on with it...Here's what I will say about my experience with Enterprise (and yes, I realize that there could be [read: are] others having wildly different experiences based on location, direct management, position, et al); in my experience if you show up hungry every day, work hard, learn something, and stay focused you will advance and you will be compensated for it. It sounds overly cliché, but it's not. I've had several managers both in operations and in commercial, some (ok one) of them very difficult, but I was still advanced and continued to receive merit increases because I refused to give in to the temptation of complacency. The culture of Enterprise is such that actual hard work, team-building and dedication will be rewarded, and nay-saying, laziness and complacency will stick out like a sore thumb. Cliché or not, that's what I've experienced, and there's my two cents.. ";1;
1389;4194;For the first 3 years I RAVED about working for this company. I've been in my profession for nearly 40 years and this is by far the best company I have worked for. Then Dan Duncan, the founder, died and the sharks took over. Dan started out as a truck driver and built a multi billion dollar enterprise but he never forgot what it meant to take care of the workers. I still love my job after seven years. Excellent pay and benefits. Depends on your location and department as to how well you will be treated.. ;1;
1390;4197;Stable company Good management Central location Long term growth. ;1;
1391;4198;The program has grown significantly and there has been more executive support of the rotational program as a whole. The third year focuses on Project Management and as a third year EDRP I have a project portfolio of around $9MM. This leads me to believe that they trust me with the level of responsibility required to manage small to medium projects on my own.. ;1;
1392;4200;Management makes smart decisions and thinks strategically for the long term. Still buy their units when they go on sale. Not sure how much culture nd changed since founder Dan Duncan's death, but he kept company ethical, fair, and honest.. ;1;
1393;4202;Pay is excellent after you complete your training, although it is low to start. Vacation benefits are in line with competition, Health insurance and benefits package are pretty good. Most of the employees are wonderful to work with, company provided truck very nice to have.. ;1;

1401;4219;Great Pay, chances for advancement quickly, Friday's early dismissal. Heavy interaction with upper management.. ;1;

1403;4225;Competitive salary in the industry. Company is growing with opportunities to move into different departments. Lots of new process units being constructed.. ;1;
1404;4229;Good pay good benefits. Management could care less about your well being or happiness. Push rates push rates push rates, but if something happens its your fault. No matter if you've been told to operate manual bypasses on valves, unit swings, valves shut, and pop psv. Management told you too, but it's your fault.. ;1;

2111;6640;Chevron offers many opportunities for professional development and growth. It's important to take advantage of all employee development opportunities.. ;1;
2112;6643;For a chemical or mechanical engineer, you'll get to fully use your education. Entry-level pay is strong versus competitors, the work is challenging, and developmental opportunities are robust. In fact, the executives themselves managed to climb the ladder from the ranks of the engineers so theoretically you can make it to the very top. Employee investment is very front-loaded towards new hires, both in terms of technical training as well as business acumen training. Bonuses are good at Chevron and there's still a pension which is increasingly atypical of employers these days. There are opportunities to develop skills which are valuable outside of Chevron. Take advantage of these. The Data Science and Lean Sigma programs are very underutilized and can make you valuable outside the lumbering dinosaur of Oil & Gas.. ;1;
2113;6644;Work life balance. Interesting work.. ;1;
2114;6649;Pay and benefits are great! The camaraderie with the other operator and mechanics is irreplaceable. The company actually cares about their employees and will do more than expected to accommodate people. I miss working there I just wish they didn't operate mainly out of California.. ;1;

It's a program that ideally will help with molding a better culture that will eliminate the ""good 'ol boy"" mentality in Oil & Gas industry.. ";1;

2172;6831;I recommend this job to anyone. If anyone is thinking of applying to this job go for it but make sure it's for a corporate station. I worked for chevron for 7 years. I started at the end of my senior year of high school and left a year and a half after I graduated college. I really loved that chevron and my manager were able to work with my school schedule no matter what it was. They understood that school was my priority. Not only did they help with my schedule but they also paid 75% of my tuition (limit per year). The company really cares for their employees and all kinds of bosses come to see the store. I've met the president of Chevron (not many companies take the time to meet their workers). They offer so many resources and opportunities for employees. Even the DO's for my area were amazing. Chevron was just such a caring company. AND I love and miss their health care and there 401 K benefit. (after writing the review I'm considering going back). ;1;
2173;6832;Work lift balance, truly care about their employees well being. ;1;
2174;6833;Lots of resources, good pay and great work life balance. Pretty good work culture.. ;1;

2179;6847;9/80 schedule, general great peers and coworkers. Engaging work, interesting industry, and even without drinking the kool-aid you can recognize the impact of your work on the economy and environment. High commitment to environmental safety and goals around clean energy (despite what some media may claim). Compensation and benefits are great, which is why they keep people for so long. Lots of opportunity to rotate and learn new skills if you're proactive and network effectively. 8% 401(k) match if you contribute 2%. Pension too, which is generally unheard of for non-gov't jobs.. ;1;
2180;6850;Lots of opportunities to do different jobs. Great colleagues and competent managers. Benefits also a plus pension DB and 401k.. ;1;
2181;6851;Company truly cares about it's employees. Focus on development and growth with rewards through benefits and opportunities.. ;1;
2182;6853;Great work culture in relation to work life balance, and there are benefits to working on the client side in that the bankers travel to our location instead of having to travel out.. ;1;
2183;6857;great benefits, management staff, training, and salary. ;1;
2184;6858;Friendly coworkers 9/80 Schedule Training and development opportunities are plentiful Relaxed work environment. ;1;
2185;6861;The benefits package at Chevron is literally unmatched in any other company or industry that I have seen. I had good managers and bad managers while there. There is mobility there and opportunity there, but they base this on a two year life-cycle which is not ideal in some cases. They put a high regard on development and have a well developed self-improvement program. Chevron has a very specific culture which can either be a good thing or a bad thing. I found the culture rewarding in that it strongly focuses on safety and health, but I also found it annoying in some ways for those exact same reasons. It is hard to describe until you are in the midst of it. But Chevron has a strong culture, and they take it seriously. Most organizations I've been with pay lip-service to their culture, Chevron does not--their culture is taken seriously. Working in IT, I've never experience a good work/life balance in my career, however Chevron has been the best company I've worked at to date for this balance.. ;1;

2615;8180;Stable work environment, flexible hours, pretty good work/life balance. ;1;
2616;8184;"Good hours. Decent pay. Good benefits. If you're on a good team or find good mentors, you can have a very successful career here and there is no set ""career path"" so you can find which part of the business you like and steer yourself in that direction.. ";1;
2617;8188;Progressive company that treats contractors like employees. Worked in Chicago /Indiana area for 4 years. Safety oriented company with many safety programs to benefit welfare of people, environment, and surrounding communities,. ;1;
2618;8190;Promotes diversity, focus on work life balance, friendly and respectful working environment.. ;1;
2619;8197;This company has awesome benefits: 7% match t 401k and 7% profit sharing contribution to a pension plan. After 50, you start accumulating health insurance benefits for retirement.. ;1;
2620;8198;Company made a huge investment of time, money and human capital to address the needs of those impacted in the gulf.. ;1;
2621;8199;If you can get in to BP you are set for life.. ;1;
2622;8202;Good overall review. Good Benefits. In general the Management structure in Alaska worked fairly well. I will work for BP again if given the opportunity. ;1;
2623;8206;excellent compensation and benefits, work life balance, and interesting projects. ;1;
2624;8207;Good diversity of opportunities within this company.. ;1;
2625;8209;Great mentoring available, competitive salaries, good work/life balance. ;1;
2626;8214;BP is a great place to start a career. They will train you, expose you to many different aspects/places in the E&P world, and provide you with the tools to succeed in your job. BP has so many different producing areas in their portfolio that you gain a wide range of skills over a very short time frame.. ;1;
2627;8215;Interned twice at BP, went full time. Now working elsewhere. Got fired for something I deserved to be fired for. If you get an offer at BP, take it. Period. The work environment is so amazing that it sounds too good to be true to your friends. Big projects, big money, big opportunities. Just incredible. I never met a single jerk at BP. People were willing to put down their work and help you so often. Great gym, great campus, just awesome.. ;1;
2628;8219;"Excellent compensation Fantastic people Great work culture BP seeks to ""do the right thing"" in everything it approaches on a day-to-day basis and in the big picture; EXAMPLE on a grand scale- while the Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill was a horrific accident, BP did not run away from it's responsibilities (unlike other companies who have had oil spill accidents) Great opportunities for career growth Global company. ";1;
2629;8221;This company offers good remuneration, it is safety focused, offers a good technical environment and gives the young engineer a very good way of starting off their career. ;1;
2630;8223;#NOM?;1;
2631;8224;Good benefits (401k with company matching up to 6%), pension, insurance, educational assistance, training, etc. Some groups have 9/80 work schedule and others may allow for other flexible working schedules.. ;1;
2632;8226;As a cashier at this BP convenience store for nearly 7 years, it was a pleasure to meet so many people in a small town with a very welcoming community. The job was enjoyable and a great way to start my working career in high school. Started at minimum wage and, within 3 years, I reached the hourly rate cap for cashiers. Hours are incredibly flexible and the manager really wants you to be successful, considering this is the first job for some high school students in the area.. ;1;
2633;8228;Lots of development, VERY performance focused, stable. Mobility helps you advance. SAFETY IS A KEY PRIORITY to get right if you're with this company. Was open to transparency long before expected at other companies. Good policy structures. I never felt out of bounds for asking questions if done the right way, nor was I pressured to do things unethical/out of bounds while I was there.. ;1;
2634;8229;#NOM?;1;
2635;8230;I believe that the management strives to be fair and tries to do the right thing even in these trying times for the oil industry.. ;1;
2636;8231;Fair Pay / Benefits Challenging / Engaging Projects and Opportunities to be a Part of Open to Professional Development Opportunities (certifications, continuing education, etc) Large Company that Provides Many Opportunities for Networking (both in and out of the company) I have had positive experiences with direct line managers - professional and supportive. ;1;
2637;8233;One of the best companies that I have ever worked for. They beleive in their core values, putting safety and family first., s well as giving back to the community. There is always an abundance of resources to get any job completed successfully, and always a team environment to work in, as well as a good atmosphere. Nine-Eighty work schedule.. ;1;
2638;8237;Been working at BP for a little under a year now, and so far it's be a great experience. The people are great, and there appears to be a lot of opportunities for advancement.. ;1;
2639;8238;The people are great and BP respects a balance between work and life. It's always about people first and production second. I'm proud to work here. I always feel supported by management and my opinions are valued.. ;1;
2640;8239;BP has a top notch portfolio with one of the best records of reserves replacment. Training is excellent and consideration for flexibility in life issues is above average. The wild-cat wells are often genuinly wild-cats.. ;1;
2641;8243;BP has some great strategic thinkers who will keep the business a competitive supermajor for a long time. In general, it makes good decisions on a global scale, and has some of the best technology in the industry. It allows for flexible work hours and it truly does try to provide for a balance between personal and work life.. ;1;
2642;8244;Large company, lots of training opportunities, great benefits and compensation, lots of opportunity in different areas so you can move around and find your niche, lots of responsibility. ;1;
2643;8245;#NOM?;1;
2644;8246;"Actually if you work hard and are unrelenting in accomplishing your job, this place has fairly decent opportunities. Management will at least act like they are listening to you. Management won’t fly of the handle and scream or lose their cool very often, if ever. The company is getting its VPP (variable pay for performance) package to be fairer in rewarding those who work hard and consistently. Hourly people can get a VPP in four different brackets; (a.) under expectations=0% bonus, (b.) meets expectations=7% bonus, (c.) exceeds expectations=17.5% bonus, (d.) exceptional=21% bonus. It is a little more complex than that but, not much and it is pretty fair in a lot of ways. They match 401k at 7%, administered through Fidelity. The overall resources for work /life balance are pretty great considering the size of the company. I get four forty hour weeks paid vacation every year, but I work 84 hour weeks offshore so I really get two offshore weeks off every year. They pay $250 towards fitness equipment for you to buy for your home uses every year, plus $300 for participating in other health initiatives through BPhit program. So, I can have six weeks in a row off every year without missing my base check. Nice. You won’t ever be harassed for taking the time to do the job safely or environmentally friendly. They do have mechanisms in place to report unethical management practices so that you have a form of recourse if they want you to take unnecessary chances or risks. I appreciate the fact that even if they are truly at heart an oil company, they are taking steps to create a greener company. Overall, I am pretty happy with the company, for what it is and what industry it is in.. ";1;
2645;8248;Excellent company! Definitely one of the best (if not the best) company I worked for in terms of taking care of employees. I am not sure there is anything else a company can do to take better care of people. There is constant concern about how people feel and a desire to keep people motivated.. ;1;
2646;8249;Working at a refinery is never going to be a typical/relaxing 8-5 gig, but generally speaking, the work-life balance is rather good. Overall compensation is relatively on par with industry competitors.. ;1;
2647;8250;There are a large number of opportunities available to employees all over the globe. Because of these opportunities you have the ability to really pick your own career path and this means there is a career path available for all different types of people.. ;1;
2648;8251;A person early in their career may do well to exploit BP's passion for hiring them as relatively cheap labor. They could jump ship in a few or if they want to be a bureaucrat they could be happy staying. There can be work-life balance in some areas, and there are a few pockets of interesting work.. ;1;
2649;8254;They like to pay their employees bonuses. The people are very friendly and the corporate culture/environment is very easy going. They have several networking opportunities within the company including affinity networks and have several lunch and learns for professional or technical development. They are also heavily involved with the surrounding community.. ;1;
2650;8255;Large Oil and Gas international business. Many internal opportunities. Pay and bonuses are good. Many wonderful co-workers.. ;1;
2651;8256;The PSCM function at BP is growing rapidly, the on the job opportunities and learning were abundant. They treat the interns to paid housing, very competitive pay, and relocation reimbursement. BP also made strong efforts to extend business travel opportunities to interns for extended and enhanced job learning.. ;1;
2652;8257;"BP allows for its interns, employees that are hungry for advancement to take part in projects that have a large impact to the company's performance. They provide opportunity for travel, training, life time mentors, performance awards up to Global Helios including networking with thousands of employees and suppliers. Looking back...my experience gained from working at BP after working in many channels of trade all over the globe was one of the best experiences I could have truly ever have ever earned in the work place. I know what it is like to be a lucky full time employee working at BP, politics including all the pros and cons mentioned. These are all great rants and raves and I heard them all looking out. Pre Spill, Pre sale of EOR retail, I mistakenly accepted a position through a widely known recruiting agency with another East Coast American fortune 500 global energy company for more money. Since that day in 2006 I realized the true value and see the big picture of being part of one of the largest companies in the world. My two cents as a former employee … If you have a career shift in any light outside of BP, then you will most likely find value of the time you spent at BP is not necessarily a waste, but rather simply another part of your new journey. In a sense, you may look back every now and then and say; “You don’t know what want till it’s gone”. I feel the lucky full time BP employees may have the last of good jobs/careers left in U.S.A.. ";1;
2653;8261;Great company for work/life balance. ;1;
2654;8262;Great pay, great benefits, great bonus structure, good work and personal life balance.. ;1;

2658;8269;Work with a great operations team. They utilize best management practices for various location which allows each site to do certain things in a way that bets suits them.

2660;8272;Great pay and benefits. The comedy never ends with terrible upper management decisions that only make the common worker more money. There is so much money in utter confusion.. ;1;

2670;8297;Great place to work. Competent management and motivated co-workers. Company really cared about employees well being and there was great opportunity for professional growth and development. The Carson plant had a lot of great people and strong culture left over from the ARCO days.. ;1;
2671;8299;Good health benefits with low premiums. 401k matching up to 7%. Salary and bonus compensation is competitive and in line with market. 9-80 schedule is a huge perk.

2672;8301;The compensation is in line with the industry, but the learning is where the opportunities really stand out. What I take away from it all on a daily basis has really helped my job growth in the time I've been with the company and hope to continue at my current pace.. ;1;

2781;8562;As a cashier at this BP convenience store for nearly 7 years, it was a pleasure to meet so many people in a small town with a very welcoming community. The job was enjoyable and a great way to start my working career in high school. Started at minimum wage and, within 3 years, I reached the hourly rate cap for cashiers.

2791;8581;$$$, pension, matching 401k and yearly bonus... only average though compared to local market. Company is great when it comes to family or medical emergencies. No thanks to management, I think HR probably forces managers to behave like decent human beings on most occasions. Company has clearly done a lot to promote women in the workplace over the last few years. Quite entertaining meetings where you'll see and hear what must be some of the most incompetent, try-hard people on the planet spew a lifetime supply of buzzwords and navigate through the endless wilderness of BP corporate processes and re-organization.

2798;8606;In my experiernce, BP employs truly quality people. I spent a summer there as an intern and was impressed with most of their employees.

2800;8608;People oriented and flexible in work-life balance.. ;1;
2801;8611;A person early in their career may do well to exploit BP's passion for hiring them as relatively cheap labor.

They insisted we maintain a good work life balance so if we had to pull long weekends or evenings as DBAs often do they insisted on giving us comp time on other days. I never once worked more than 80 hours during a 2 week period in my 30 months there. They let us bring on staff in India who could do most work during off hours for us which helped the work life balance even more. Pay was very good.. ;1;
