2021-09-19;Anonymous;Current Employee, more than 8 years;Broken;"Some amazing colleagues. Decent pace in getting new assignments. Not too much micro-management and good level of responsibility/influence for individual contributors.
";"More and more, the wrong people are become supervisors without adequate skills and training. Management will defend them to no end while constantly criticizing individual contributors. The amount of rework on small things is outrageous meanwhile critical tasks aren't getting completed due to poor work prioritization from the supervisor. New performance assessments are more of a popularity and personality contest as supervisors fail to understand and give proper credit for real work by employees. People will tell outright lies to try and get their way or put others down. Employee concerns are not properly addressed as the organization only cares about what's coming from the top-down. The individuals who do care aren't are in a position to bring change. Work life balance and flex policies are a joke for most jobs. My coworkers are stressed, frustrated, and running out of patience. Despite all this, management continues to paint things as a pretty picture and will repeatedly talk about culture and ""one team"" and how we should be so excited to be a part of this work. There are way too many managers and too many p***ing contests that results in lack of clarity and constant change in direction for individual contributors. Leadership team is nearly all male and white. Contributions by and perspective from people of color are diminished whereas others are recognized for doing base business job functions.

";"Non-transparent leadership. Politics, general bureaucracy continue to trump culture change attempts and ranking. Ranking relative to peers - so there will always be someone in the bottom to fire no matter how talented/hard working they are. Ranking system focused on number of worklist items completed and not taking into account intangible impacts like mentoring, taking initiative to step up to fill gaps for advising, creating/maintaining strong teams and a positive culture. Supervisors resist real change despite being advocates for culture change. Culture change driven from top down and formed to suit leadership although presented to satisfy the majority of the workforce. Company struggles to remedy low moral after COVID-19; 401k match paused and sizeable firings disguised as headcount studies and performance rankings. Company leadership has directly replied to the workforce that they should be happy and thankful they still have a job when asked what the leadership's plan was to resolve low morale and restore the elements that attract and retain employees. Only 2 weeks vacation for new hires, do not get 3rd week until 5 years of service (they do honor previous employment).

2021-08-19;Supply Chain Coordinator;Former Employee, more than 1 year;Escape while you can!;"- Some peers make this place bearable through trauma bonding - The campus is beautiful and you can take froyo breaks - If you are lucky enough to be at one of the Houston sites, you do not have state income tax - You get to learn if you like oil, gas, & chemicals or not
";"- The worst management (including supervisors) gets promoted & many are micromanagers - Upper management has selective hearing when it comes to feedback - Some sites (Beaumont and Baton Rouge) are worse than living in Chernobyl - All the diverse and friendly people leave within the first couple of years - Executives like pocketing more money for themselves while lower level employees face minimal salary raises (if we get salary raises) - Lack of transparency across the board (i.e. we learn of salary freezes, 401k cuts, layoffs, etc. through news outlets) - The younger generation knows this industry is not sustainable and views Exxon as the most evil compared to its peers - Communications on serious issues (i.e. COVID, BLM, Anti-Asian rhetoric) are purely reactive and are put out there as a response to employee dissatisfaction - Working from home for non-essential roles was not an option, even as peers contracted COVID-19. The company's scapegoat was ""they likely were exposed during their lunch break"" since the exposure could not be ""proven"" to occur during the 12-person meeting in the conference room (note this was before vaccines were rolled out). - Everything is an ""emergency"" in the eyes of management and they will drain your energy preparing for minute issues - Overall lack of diversity that will continue to propagate discriminatory behavior and microaggressions throughout the company - ""This is the way we've always done it, so we will continue doing everything this way"" will get you rewarded rather than challenging the status quo - The CEO and other executives only care about shareholders, never the individual contributors - Town Halls will actively censor messages and questions - ""Management's hands are tied"" is the excuse that is communicated for everything - Roles will continue to be outsourced abroad to save costs, despite the additional complications with timely communications - Management will not admit that they a culture revamp to retain talent - Talent is escaping to industries that better value their employees (i.e. Tech & Consulting), but Exxon will not enhance their benefits package accordingly - Only Chemical Engineering degrees are truly valued in the company. This is a not-so-secret expectation on how to quickly accelerate your career here. - Sustainability initiatives are minimal - In order to be successful, you are required to follow a traditional career path through manufacturing roles - If you do something bad, supervisors will not support you. If you do something good, supervisors will take credit for the work you did. - The expectation is that you need to respond within 24 hours if someone needs you while on vacation - The cultural issues stem throughout the entire company! Not only within one function (i.e. chemicals vs. upstream or supply chain vs. technical) - A supervisor once told me ""the people who do well here take ownership,"" which is ironic considering that the company as a whole has not been taking ownership over its poor culture that has caused top talent to apply elsewhere.

2021-08-26;Law Department;Current Employee, more than 8 years;Limited growth opportunity and rigorous competitive ranking system for all professionals;"Good place for experience. Lots of good co-workers. Very diverse and woke culture. Benefits are not excellent like they used to be but are still ok. Good place to be from. Looks great on a resume.
";"Opportunities for promotion are limited except for the top 20% of the rank group. Forced, competitive ranking for all professionals, while system is made to look objective is remains highly subject to preferential assignment opportunities, and subjective ranking largely influenced by whether you're in favor with the ranking management. Talent, hard work, amount of work product, quality of work, are not the main determinants of success. Sadly, having the ""right"" corporate appearance and image carry more weight in long-term success than technical or professional skills and production. For most employees, raises are mere cost of living adjustments. The few in the top get the vast lions share of promotions and advancement. The lower half of the rank group will get virtually nothing annually and maybe a one percent raise every 18 months to two years. Notwithstanding the fact that everyone they hire is an academic and professional standout just to get hired in the first place. The company is a morale killer. Stock has not performed and has lost value for over ten years running. The company is in decline.

Have to be “sponsored” by a higher level manager to survive performance ranking and to get decent project assignments so you can perhaps advance in the company. Management tends to lack integrity with their own people. They say they value diversity and inclusion though actions in meetings, decision making, etc. it is obvious they do what they want…still an old white mans, good ol’ buddy mindset…fear and command.

2021-08-17;Business Controls Advisor;Current Employee, more than 8 years;It used to be a decent company;"I worked in Controllers organization and you will get lot of opportunities to learn the business. I've done financial reporting, operations accounting, process and controls, internal audit. Generally the rotation is about 3 years on average. You can't get bored but you have to learn fast. XOM has great expat policy and have great expat opportunities as well, if you're lucky to get on the list.
";"Management sucks. In my 20 years career in XOM I had just few great managers who were developing their personnel. There is lots of politics and brown-nosing. Recent manager that I had was just thinking about how to promote herself and introduced inefficient and unnecessary initiative so it will look good on her performance. In general, XOM behind in implementing the latest technology (apart from core business, like engineering). My manager was afraid to implement technological efficiencies because it would require some extra access reviews to be done. It's like you shoot to the stars and she is still in the cave and doesn't want to go out. The other manager didn't even talk to his direct reports. We were wondering if he was fulfilling his responsibilities and what was going in the company. Although there are great managers who cares about personnel and develop them, if you're lucky, then you will do good and have fun at work. One of the most disappointing thing about XOM is that management is lying a lot. Like recent layoff based on performance. Lots of people are getting assessed as ""need significant improvement"" on unreasonable grounds. Coworker has been told that his communication required significant improvement and what matters is ""...it's not what you do, it's how you do it"". Most people who have gotten bad performance reviews didn't see it coming, meaning that management was satisfied with their work the whole year. Who needs to work on their communication? $1M question. The other important part is salary and benefits. XOM adds benefits like paternity leave, flex time because it's competitors introduced those and XOM was forced to do the same. Salary increase is minimum to none, company match gone (they are going to reinstate it back in October), health plan is expensive, 401K funds are low performers. Bad time for energy sector but board members did get their bonuses. Why?

A general unwillingness to change due to an arrogance of “being the best in business” — even if that was 10+ years ago. Even then, ExxonMobil was mistaking correlation with causality — their success then was despite their actions, not because of them. 4. A culture of fear. 5. Stacked rankings. 6. Overall, the work is mostly entirely meaningless and without any impact. This is not something you’ll want to tell your grandchildren about. 7. 90% of decision are made in Dallas, Houston and all other small offices are just there to push paper. 8.

The matching savings plan is coming back for the foreseeable future. It’s a great name on the resume and will take you far. Great way to change companies.
";"Toxic culture. Toxic supervisors/managers cover for toxic supervisors/managers. The ghost layoffs are masked under the new ranking process to force employees out of the company. A ranking system that is used to layoff employees, particularly those new, older age or with the company for over 10 years. Compensation does not keep up with inflation or cost of living. Be prepared to deal with HR incompetence when trying to get a straight answer about ranking results. Company is a house of cards that will not change with the times/move swiftly like tech companies for example. It’s an imploding dinosaur. First and second line supervisors are not screened properly. Which is why the company becomes a breeding ground for a toxic micro cultures all across the company, up to the very top. There’s great managers out there but they usually can’t do much to stop the fires or poison seeping to other areas of the company. It’s a sad story. Once mighty Exxon, it has become a sad story of fallen giant. Its internal culture is a mirror image of the public’s toxic perception of the company. People should continue leaving. Other companies pay better and promote employees all throughout their career.

Cultural fears to admit poor decision making; can't admit poor decisions (hubris). Highly pain in processes (think government processes).

The pension is the main reason why a lot of people dont leave and they know it. Spring campus amenities (tons of food options and a great gym). Most companies cant match oil and gas pay. Most oil and gas companies cant match Exxon's stability. Exxon has only had legitimate layoffs twice since 1999 (merger then COVID). They figured out work/life balance a while back which is good.
";"Exxon is very quick to let you know where you stand. Certain career paths are granted/denied certain things with no clear reason why (ex: some new hires are granted previous experience but other jobs dont get any previous experience granted). Exxon has a horrible culture but isnt willing change anything unless it affects their bottom line.

2021-07-21;Engineer;Current Employee;Fast Sinking Ship;"Salary, well until you flatten out
";"And I will quote a senior manager during a ranking session a few years ago “why is everyone so fussed about this process. It’s just about salary administration”. Flash forward a couple of years and I guess what he meant is administration of no salary upon layoffs of highly capable people. The desire to cling to an early 1900s management philosophy of fear and punishment is driven by those who benefited from this system. The remaining 80-90% who make up the rest and will never make it are suffering from some degree of demotivation by the process. The true leaders who try to keep us going never make it very far because inept senior leadership needs them in low positions to get real results. Many of those great leaders who endured are walking away for better things in and out of this industry. There is a serious lack of vision and an attitude of “don’t worry it will all be fine” as it is clear the ship is sinking! I implore anyone considering hiring on to at least look at the stock price over the last 5 years. After recovering from COVID lows the downward trend is right where it has been for that period. That is an objective reflection of the dismal quality of senior leadership.

Pros
Global company with lots of opportunity to work in the US and overseas Variety of experiences in many types of Hydrocarbon energy, chemicals and plastics.
Cons
Drastically reduced manpower, pay and benefits in the last 24 months. Asking remaining people to do more, with less, for less. It is a company of Managers - NOT LEADERS! Old thinking - not terribly agile in today's business world - UNWILLING to even consider solar/Wind power as a viable option - claim to be an energy company - but really on oil and gas Arrogant - smartest guy in the room syndrome. Family considerations are talked about, but truly don't matter.

";"If it was possible, I would publish a 500 page paper on why not to work at ExxonMobil if you're in tech. Top 4: 1) Management is a joke. It truly felt they hired the least qualified people in so many areas of management. Terrible at relationships. Even more terrible with tech. Because they give you the option to ""switch roles ever couple of years"", your first line boss truly determines your future. If you first boss doesn't like you or reviews you poorly, say goodbye to your career. There were good bosses, but they were extremely outnumbered. 2) Wasting budget. So many teams went through ""Agile"" training and it was truly embarrassing to see Exxon get swindled into paying for such a long term engagement for something that takes other groups a couple of weeks to get nailed down. 3) Ranking, they rebranded it, but it's still the same draconic ranking system as before. It does not encourage people to work together or give credit when it's due. At the end of the day, it's all about ensuring your ranking is high enough. 4) Work from home policy, some roles require you to be in the office for equipment purposes, software for the most part is not one of them. I could hear my ranking slowly go down every time I asked to work from home.

";"This used to be a good to place to work, not the greatest company for innovation, creativity or teamwork but the trade off was a stable “hire to retire” culture with solid business fundamentals, focus on safety and the chance of working with experienced and solid professionals. Yes you had to deal with a ranking system that destroyed any attempt of having a collaborative environment, and culture was focused on following procedures and working for complying with internal audits instead of fostering new ideas and teamwork, but working hard was typically rewarded and you could count on a long term career… Everything dramatically changed the last couple of years, ranking system was redesigned to make it easier to place employees at the bottom, you could be a sustained good performer for 5+ years and suddenly end up being offered a 3 lay off package for having had a “bad year”. There have been layoffs all across functions and affiliates, and the company demanded employees to return to the office back as early as May 2020, when pandemic was still at its peak… Environment became toxic and morale is at its lowest, and key benefits also took a hit. This has been a fundamental shift away from what used to be company core values, and a real shame. Unless this is your only option, I would discourage anyone to join EM at the moment.

Jun 7, 2021 - Financial Analyst in Houston, TX
Recommend
CEO Approval
Business Outlook
Pros
The salary is great and well above what one needs to live comfortably in Houston. Exxon claims they routinely monitor and compete with salary and benefits that competitors offer, although rumor has it that it is no longer the top 10%, but mid-range. The benefits are great. You can pay about half the amount for medical insurance if you complete a few tasks annually. You get four dental cleanings a year that are paid for. There is a DB pension plan in addition to a 401k match (assuming they bring it back). Paid maternity leave along with temporary disability. There is unrivaled growth potential, especially if you take initiative and demonstrate you are able to save the company money. They try to accommodate your career interests with open job opportunities. The Spring campus is beautiful and has a state-of-the-art gym, on site dentist, optometrist, food court, and other shops. Additionally, management tries to be flexible on days you have other personal commitments. I never had to worry about leaving early or working from home if I had a doctor's appointment, home delivery, etc.
Cons
They infamously suspended the 401k match at the peak of the coronavirus. It is made abundantly clear that working from home long-term is out of the question unless you have a job assignment that warrants it (e.g auditor) because they want you to utilize the campus and collaborate in-person. Upper management is extremely far-removed from the day-to-day tasks and issues, partially due to the fact that Exxon is such a huge company, but this can be a problem for recurring issues that to them might be minute, but to the average worker cause a lot of frustration and angst.

Travel often allows stays in 4 star hotels and generous food allowance. Any corporate department that you can imagine that any large company and sometimes a person can move into that department if your manager supports you. Varied assignments during your career. The company has the potential to make a lot of money as the price of oil rises and some of that money may return to employees in higher raises and increased training opportunities.
";"Jobs are being cut all over Europe, Canada, Singapore and the USA to move jobs to locations where costs are cheaper. People being hired in many of these locations do not have the same dedication to the company and realize that they make less so when you get a supervisor or manager from one of these countries when you work in the USA expect resentment. The management in the USA talked for years that people were hired for a career from college to retirement but they have pushed people out by increasing poor performers to as high as 10% in some years to avoid paying layoff packages. The company forced many people to retire. The company cares about employees only if they are cheap to pay. Early in a person's career they are identified to be a top performer and after that time you can fall from being a top performer but it is almost impossible to get into the top rankings each year once the company has decided your career level in your first few years at the company.

2021-04-17;Laboratory Technician;Former Employee, more than 5 years;Cut benefits, office politics, and toxic leadership;"The pay is decent, and you won't take your work home with you.
";"The job is mind-numbingly simple and routine. Two of the supervisors and the lab manager are toxic to those that work under them, patronizing when honest feedback is given, and then act shocked when new hires and contractors don't last six months before moving on to better positions at other companies. Almost all benefits were cut last year while the company shareholder dividend was maintained, and no raises were given out. There is extremely low morale, but with current leadership, it is being ignored rather than addressed. Claims of the utmost focus on quality go out the window when production metrics are threatened. Constantly short-staffed due to high turnover rate (because of excessively low morale). Would highly recommend you look elsewhere for lab work; this facility is a dead end.

";"Company has been in decline for a decade now - it has been hollowed out. Once-strong culture has devolved into an echo chamber of yes-men, who compete to flatter the management layer above them. Technical work is no longer primary - there is direct and indirect pressure to produce the politically expected outcome. By now we have a whole generation of managers raised like that and hijacking the company to enrich themselves. This does not bode well for the company's future.

Little prospect for growth, but this is mostly due to old nature of Oil&Gas industry. During annual review you will be told generic lines by your supervisor to justify your rank if you are in the middle or bottom. Work culture is toxic and employees bad mouth each other just to get a head (i.e. dirty competition encouraged by the new management) If you are at early stages of your career, and smart, then I recommend putting your efforts in alternate companies and industries that have better chance of success.

2021-02-20;Anonymous;Current Employee, more than 10 years;Mixed Bag;"Good pay; healthcare benefits and the pension (if it lasts); colleagues are generally intelligent, motivated, and pleasant to work with; can end up working interesting projects; training used to be good, but dropped off in the last few years; first line supervisors are mixed but I've generally had good experiences.
";"Upper management is detached, reactive, and apparently incompetent. The culture is very top down, and employees are expected to defer to (and frankly live in awe of) those with positions of authority. This is to the detriment of the organization, since upper management typically develops a distorted view of actual operations. On a related note, management frequently seems to ignore recommendations from technical staff. EM used to offer relative career stability for a company in the oil and gas industry, but that's out of the window now, especially for employees in ""high cost"" locations (USA, Australia, Canada, Western Europe). 2020 layoffs in high cost regions were handled poorly (starting with mandated cuts from gaming the performance management system) and greatly eroded internal organizational trust. Already seeing relatively heavy voluntary attrition as a result. Performance management/ranking system has always been bad but it's gotten worse through time, especially lately. EM is definitely on the wrong side of history. Though there's likely a long term future for oil and gas on some level, the industry is probably at the precipice of a long term contraction as renewable energy grows. IOC's and especially XOM are particularly vulnerable to this, especially with the current management and company strategy. Finally, the brand is toxic and the company knows it.

And during Covid, if you have a HIPPA or another medical exemption to not wear a mask, we are supposed to kick you out of the store. Overall it’s all about the income, not about customer satisfaction or or happiness. Our pumps don’t read right. They short you. Or Tank Systems have faults every where. I know we don’t have what we need to be up to date or all the stuff to keep the place clean. Definitely feel like they cut corners on safety but not sure where other than the Tank Information Systems. Alarms are constantly going off in the tanks but they say they are faulty and not to worry about them. Just had a bunch of Water in the Diesel Tanks that the State Department (FINALLY!!!!) stepped in and shut down the sale of Diesel. And finally other than it’s usually hot in the store. The cooler is Definitely an OSHA violation, if not the entire store. The pay seems to not be stable. My checks as well as other employees seem to be jumping between constant number.

2021-01-28;Process Engineer;Former Employee, more than 1 year;Great Pay but they make you Pay for it;"The pay is fantastic, flexible hours, great health benefits
";"As a Person of Color, my time with ExxonMobil was quite stressful. Most of the people are great to work with but supervisors are mostly micromanagers, diversity is not their strongest suit. Lots of white males in upper management. Too much discrimination at the workplace, sutle but it's there. Some of the operators won't like you because you're a young engineer coming in to tell them how to do their job, it takes time and patience to build a connection with them but overall great people to work with. Lots of fake people go behind your back to talk bad about you. Work hours can be crazy, it's part of the job description that you have your work phone with you 24/7. Anyone at the plant can contact you so say bye to Work-Life balance. If you do have a doctor's appt. or so you can get time off or be allowed to come to work late, supervisors do differ. Work hours can be long, when you're new it's expected you're at the plant later than everyone getting to know your unit and operators. ExxonMobil has a ranking system every year to discuss your performance but if your supervisor doesn't like you, you won't have someone to defend your work and speak for you. They do allow you to have Knowledgable Others that can speak on your character and work ethics but your peers are competing with you so not a lot of people you can trust to speak highly of you. Advice: go to work do your job and work hard if you're a POC waiting for recognition don't count on it, your counterparts would get recognized before you. The supervisors secretly will give you more than you can do so you don't look good to management.

Usually most people who gets hired have a long term career in mind so job security had been good until recently.
";"Controversial performance assessment/Ranking program that pits against each other. Rather than team/organization success being recognized, someone always has be at the bottom no matter what. Sometimes too much job changes and organization changes which results is difficulty in team normalizing.

";"Management has no care or connection to the workforce and is moving jobs from “high cost” countries to India as fast as they can. No chance of a long term career. All benefits continue to be cut as time goes on. No raises. No 401k match. No cost of living adjustments. No education or training program. No opportunities. Entire workforce is looking for employment elsewhere. Very low morale. Fired so many people that you have to do the work of two people and work 12 hour days. Workforce does not trust management. No transparency from management on plans for continued workforce reduction. Very arbitrary good old boys ranking process for identifying who to fire during annual layoffs. Company is shrinking and in decline. Opportunities from promotion limited as company is laying off not growing.
